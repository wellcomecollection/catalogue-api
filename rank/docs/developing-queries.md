# Developing new queries

Experimental queries can be tested by modifying the local query in `/data/queries`.

Rank defaults to using the live queries, which are fetched from [here](https://api.wellcomecollection.org/catalogue/v2/search-templates.json). To use the local version and see the result of your changes, toggle the ðŸ§ª on the `/search` page of rank.

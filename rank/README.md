# Rank ðŸŽ¯

Rank allows us to confidently test incremental changes to search relevance on [wellcomecollection.org/collections](https://wellcomecollection.org/collections), without degrading the existing experience.

It uses [elasticsearch's `rank_eval` API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-rank-eval.html) to measure how well a query returns the "expected" results for a set of known search terms. If the queries return the results we expect, we know we're meeting a baseline performance requirement. Better scores on those examples should mean better search satisfaction IRL, and more illustrative examples mean more classes of search behaviour/intention are met.

## Running locally

Clone this repo, `cd` into `rank`, and run:

- `yarn` to install packages
- `yarn rank` to run the relevance tests

  <summary>Matching the CI environment with docker</summary>

The following command will match the environment used in CI exactly, explicitly using the AWS credentials in your `~/.aws` directory to fetch credentials for the ES cluster.

```sh
docker run -it \
  -v $HOME/.aws:/root/.aws \
  -v $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel):/catalogue-api \
  --workdir /catalogue-api/rank \
  --env AWS_PROFILE=platform-dev \
  public.ecr.aws/docker/library/node:18-slim \
  yarn rank
```

## Choosing a cluster to run tests against

Running rank locally allows you to test against the `pipeline` or `rank` cluster.

You should almost always choose to run local experiments against the `rank` cluster with indices replicated from the `pipeline` cluster (see more details and instructions [here](../docs/search/rank/cluster.md)). The pipeline cluster is used directly by the API, so experimenting against it can be dangerous.

To minimise the risks associated with automated cross cluster replication, we run rank in CI against the `pipeline` cluster. The tests in CI use known queries, so we're much less likely to affect the performance of the API.

## Docs ðŸ“–

Rank documentation lives alongside the rest of the search docs in gitbook. You can see the markdown docs [here](../docs/search/rank/README.md).

### Developing

To start affecting search relevance, you might want to

- [develop the queries](../docs/search/rank/developing.md#queries)
- [develop the mappings](../docs/search/rank/developing.md#mappings)
- [create new tests](../docs/search/rank/developing.md#test-cases)

### Evaluating relevance

See [the instructions](../docs/search/rank/testing.md) for running the rank tests.

  * = Scoring =
  * Searches created by this trait may be ranked by query, or by KNN,
  * but not both.
  * If both a query term and a KNN are requested, then the
  * query term becomes a filter for the KNN part, rather than
  * populating a full query for itself.
  * This is because the score for a document that matches both
  * a query and a knn is the sum of both, giving no sensible provision to
  * score a document that matches both over one that very highly
  * matches one but not the other.
  *
  * = Sorting =
  * Results can be sorted by date (up or down) or score, and if neither
  * value is given, results will be sorted by id.
  * If both date and score sorting are requested, then results are sorted
  *  by date and then score.

  // would be executed in filter context and be discarded.
  // When running a KNN search, the query term becomes a simple filter
  // on whether the document contains the term in any searchable field.
  // If there are fields that should be ignored, then this default will
